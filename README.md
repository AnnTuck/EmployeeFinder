Future Changes:

Future evolution of this project might involve a graphic representation of the survey matching results.  Since the matching is not 1:1, and future users can be matched with others already matched, this app would produce interesting results over time.  It would be interesting to show graphically how the users are grouped over time.  Likely with one larger group with more common survey choices and smaller outlying groups.  Also interesting is how those who take the survey early are matched with the smaller sample of data as opposed to those who take it later.  

Observing how the grouping process plays out may lead to some new ideas of how to apply the matching method to other projects.
